# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility modules that are used to organize and modularize the Streamlit stock price prediction app. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of the application, such as data fetching, preprocessing, model definitions, evaluation, and plotting.

## Modules

1. **`data_fetching.py`**: Functions for fetching stock data and company information.
2. **`preprocessing.py`**: Data preprocessing utilities, including sequence creation and scaling.
3. **`models.py`**: Definitions for machine learning models (Linear Regression, LSTM, GRU).
4. **`evaluation.py`**: Functions for evaluating model performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ², and MAPE.
5. **`plotting.py`**: Plotting functions to visualize stock data and model predictions.

Each module is designed to be reusable and maintainable, ensuring a clean separation of concerns in the Streamlit app.
